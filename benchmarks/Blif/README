These are the twenty largest MCNC LGSynth93 circuits.  They have been
optimized via script.rugged and script.algebraic in SIS, with the smaller
output circuit generated by the two scripts taken in each case.
They were then technology-mapped to 4-input look-up tables and flip flops
via Flowmap.

In order to compare to our routing results, the sequential circuits
*must* have flip flops and LUTs combined into basic logic elements (BLEs)
where possible before placement and routing.  For this reason, we suggest
you take the .net format netlists instead of these .blif format ones.
The .net format netlists have already been mapped into BLEs.
